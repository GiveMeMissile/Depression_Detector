This app uses the .NET framework to create a MAUI app and executes python ai via pythonnet.
Using this code will require you to have a MAUI app project already set up.
And unfortunatly I cannot upload the AI model files to github as github can only upload files that are no biggr than 25m mega bytes.
And the AI model is around 100 mega bytes. So that is a big womp womp.
